## Educational Materials

I am actively involved in creating comprehensive educational materials aimed at enhancing the learning experience in mathematics. Below you'll find links to web documents and textbooks I've authored, utilizing PreTeXt, an XML application for creating high-quality educational content.

### Textbooks in Progress

Here are some of the textbooks I'm currently writing, which cover various topics in mathematics:

- **Introduction to Calculus**: An in-depth exploration of calculus fundamentals, tailored for first-year university students. [Access Textbook](link_to_textbook_1)
- **Linear Algebra Applied**: A practical approach to linear algebra, emphasizing its applications in engineering and computer science. [Access Textbook](link_to_textbook_2)

### Problem Sets and Examples

In addition to textbooks, I provide detailed explanations and examples for selected problems to further aid in understanding complex concepts:

- **Calculus Problem Set**: Solutions and walkthroughs for challenging calculus problems. [View Problems](link_to_problems_calculus)
- **Linear Algebra Examples**: A collection of key examples in linear algebra, demonstrating core principles and techniques. [View Examples](link_to_examples_linear_algebra)

Feel free to explore these resources, and stay tuned for more content as these projects evolve.
